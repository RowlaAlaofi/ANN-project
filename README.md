This project implements a Face Recognition System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 40 unique classes based on facial features.

Project Overview
The model is trained on a dataset of 400 images.
Each image is resized to 64x64 pixels for consistent input to the CNN.
The dataset contains 40 unique targets (persons), with each target having 10 images in the dataset.
The CNN architecture is designed to efficiently learn facial features and accurately classify unseen images.
